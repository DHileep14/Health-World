<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a>&nbsp;(USPSTF) is recommending two new mental health screenings for children.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The independent panel of national experts said children 12 to 18 years old should be screened for&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2797146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depression and suicide riskTrusted Source</a>.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The task force describes anxiety disorder as “a common mental health condition in the United States” that is comprised of a group of related conditions characterized by excessive fear or worry. They said the condition produces both emotional and physical symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Task force members noted that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.childhealthdata.org/docs/default-source/nsch-docs/2018-2019-nsch-fast-facts_cahmi_edited_10-2-20.pdf?sfvrsn=4a7b5f17_2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2018-2019 National Survey of Children’s Health</a>&nbsp;found that nearly 8 percent of children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years had a current anxiety disorder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence are associated with an increased likelihood of a future anxiety disorder or depression,” members of the task force wrote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The USPSTF study concluded with “moderate certainty” screening for anxiety in children 8 to 18 years old “has a moderate net benefit.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group said evidence is insufficient on screening for anxiety in children younger than 8 and for depression in children younger than 12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The task force noted that depression is a leading cause of disability in the United States. They said children and adolescents with depression typically have functional impairments in their performance at school or work and during interactions with their families and peers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>”Major depressive disorder in children and adolescents is strongly associated with recurrent depression in adulthood, other mental disorders, and increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide completion,” they wrote.</p>

<h2><a>The importance of screenings</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There is definitely a growing concern for mental health issues among children,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mindpath.com/staff/zishan-khan-md/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Zishan Khan,</a>&nbsp;a child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist with Texas-based Mindpath Health, told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Khan said screenings are important because the signs of both depression and anxiety can be subtle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“People with depression can present with isolative behavior, an intense feeling of fatigue, having a lack of energy or motivation to participate in activities they normally enjoy, sleeping and/or eating more or less than usual, and even with anger outbursts,” Khan said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Children who are anxious will often ruminate continuously, often about things most kids their age wouldn’t worry about. They may have fears about their loved ones, activities they participate in, and school, or even irrational fears about death or being separated from their family,” he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anxiety can present itself with stomach pains, headaches, or generalized weakness “which are actually somatic manifestations of their anxiety,” Khan said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Screening at a young age is important because the majority of psychiatric disorders start during childhood and adolescence,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chconline.org/people/pardis-khosravi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pardis Khosravi,</a>&nbsp;PsyD, a psychologist and clinical director at Palo Alto-based Children’s Health Council, told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Universal screening for anxiety starting at age 8 and depression by age 12 ensures that we are catching individuals during the ages where they are more likely to be developing these challenges,” Khosravi said.</p>

<h2><a>More important than ever now</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experts said mental health screenings are especially important now with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic still present.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The research is always evolving, and we are always learning more about the impact of anxiety and depression on children; however, the increase in the number of youth struggling with anxiety and/or depression is staggering,” Khosravi said. “Before the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 1 in 5 children ages 3 to 17 in the U.S. struggled with having a mental, emotional, developmental, or behavioral disorder, with anxiety and depression being the most common psychiatric disorders in youth. That number has skyrocketed since the pandemic.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s possible adults have historically underestimated the effect of depression and anxiety on youth, but there’s also more modern pressure through other relatively new factors such as social media, experts said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We continue to improve upon our understanding and conceptualization of depression and anxiety in kids,”&nbsp;<a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/rebecca_kamody/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebecca Kamody</a>, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist at Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital in Connecticut, told Healthline. “As a result, we are better able to accurately identify depressive and anxiety-related symptoms in kids, when historically we may have missed these symptoms.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Current cultural and environmental stressors have significantly impacted the risk of developing depression and anxiety in youth, further illustrating the importance of early screening and intervention to prevent escalation of severity of symptoms,” she added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experts say standard screenings can be – and are often easiest – done in the office of a child’s regular pediatrician, where a familiar face can help guide the process and offer possible referrals to other clinicians, if necessary. The screenings can also be done through school-based and community clinics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s fantastic that we’ll be completing these screenings and identifying more children who need mental health services,”&nbsp;<a href="https://anxietyspecialistsofatlanta.com/dr-cameron-mosley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron Mosley</a>, Ph.D., a licensed psychologist and clinician for Anxiety Specialists of Atlanta, told Healthline. “Of course, this does not change the fact that there are already not enough providers to meet the mental health needs of the population. Just identifying these children will not guarantee that their needs are addressed.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have a long way to go before all children will have access to affordable, evidence-based mental health care,” she added.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Researchers say anxiety disorders are more likely to be transmitted from fathers to sons as well as from mothers to daughters.</strong></li><li><strong>They say that’s because children tend to pick up traits and model behavior after the parent of the same biological sex.</strong></li><li><strong>Experts say this trend should serve as a reminder to all adults that children are watching closely what grown-ups say and do.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anxiety disorders may be transmitted from mothers to daughters as well as from fathers to sons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the conclusion of a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2794157?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=07122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studyTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;in which researchers report that anxiety may have a pattern of “sex-specific transmission.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Anxiety disorder in a same-sex parent but not in an opposite-sex parent was significantly associated with a lifetime diagnosis of any anxiety disorders in offspring,” the study authors wrote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“An association between the same-sex parent’s anxiety disorder and anxiety disorders in offspring suggests an environmental mechanism, such as modeling,” they added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5.8 millionTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;children between 3 and 17 years of age received a diagnosis of anxiety between 2016 and 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it is common for children to have some worries and fears, the CDC states that if the concerns interfere with daily life this may be due to an anxiety disorder. This can be a phobia, social anxiety, separation anxiety, panic disorder, or generalized anxiety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CDC data from 2019 found that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db378.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">15%Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;of adults experienced anxiety that was mild, moderate or severe during a two-week reporting period. Women were more likely than men to experience anxiety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What researchers learned</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers of the recent study conducted interviews with 398 children, 221 mothers, and 237 fathers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They reported that anxiety disorders in a parent of the same sex were associated with a slight increase in the rate of anxiety disorders in same-sex offspring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anxiety disorders in a parent of the opposite sex did not have the same association.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being in the same house with a parent of the same sex who didn’t have an anxiety disorder was also associated with lower rates of anxiety disorders among offspring of the same sex.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://drcarlamanly.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Carla Marie Manly</a>, a clinical psychologist based in California, says the results of the study aren’t surprising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Although both fathers and mothers have a profound impact on their children, developmental psychology has long focused on the same-sex parent’s distinct emotional and mental impact on the child. Given that young children’s brains are highly impressionable, it makes perfect sense that children would ‘absorb’ anxiety, particularly from the same-sex parent,” she told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“On a neurobiological level, young children’s brains are formed and changed by everything they encounter, including their parents’ behaviors and environment,” Manly added. “Although children are surely impacted by positive experiences, they are most certainly impacted by negative stimuli such as an anxious parent’s behaviors. As such, although a young child will not consciously adopt a parent’s modeled anxious attitudes and behaviors, the parent’s patterns will be noted and copied nonetheless.”</p>

<h2><a>How anxiety disorders develop</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers said anxiety disorders typically begin early in life and having a parent with an anxiety disorder is an established risk factor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The study authors say the risk could for a variety of reasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This association could be attributable to the parents passing on genetic risk to their offspring and the impact parents have on their children’s environment. Although a number of genetic variants associated with anxiety disorders have been identified,<sup><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2794157?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=07122#zoi220597r13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trusted Source</a></sup>some studies have concluded that the association of environment with the transmission of anxiety from parents to children is greater than that of the genetics,” they wrote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the role of same-sex parents does play a greater role in a child’s development of anxiety, the study authors argue this could be because children model their parents and learn from them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.drshaneowens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shane Owens</a>, Ph.D., a behavioral and cognitive psychologist in New York, says children will copy their parents’ example from a young age.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Kids look up to parents and are often reinforced for taking on qualities of their same-sex parent,” he told Healthline. “Most boys can remember being attended to and praised for walking around in their father’s shoes or for sitting and watching the game with their dad. Most girls remember being praised for trying on their mom’s shoes or jewelry or asking to use their makeup.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This extends to other behaviors as well, especially in times of crisis. A boy experiencing anxiety will act like his dad does; a girl experiencing anxiety will mimic her mother’s response to similar circumstances,” Owens added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This trend can be a reminder for parents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“All adults should understand that what they do in the presence of a child will likely be mimicked,” Owens explained. “Gender roles remain strong. Kids pay close attention to the parent they believe is the one they’re supposed to mimic. Because modeling behavior has the strongest effect on what kids do, it’s not surprising that sons of anxious dads and daughters of anxious mothers behave in anxious ways.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers found that the lifetime rate of anxiety disorders was lowest among children who had two parents without anxiety disorders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Children who had one parent with an anxiety disorder had an intermediate lifetime risk of anxiety disorder while children with two parents with an anxiety disorder had the highest rate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of the experts who spoke with Healthline say this makes sense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We spend the most time in our early developmental phase around our parents. We passively internalize so many of their mannerisms and characteristics that it makes perfect sense that anxiety would be more prominent in individuals where it was present in both parents,”&nbsp;<a href="https://findadoctor.kansashealthsystem.com/provider/Gregory+E+Nawalanic/1220592" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregory Nawalanic</a>, a clinical psychologist at The University of Kansas Health System, told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Children look to their parents as anchors of stability. Imagine the message that is sent and internalized by the child who sees their parents consistently in a state of alarm or fear. It colors the world around them as a threatening place and confirms their age-appropriate fear of the unknown rather than dispelling it and communicating calm and safety,” he added.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Nearly 10 percent of children in the U.S. will get a diagnosis of anxiety.</strong></li><li><strong>Now experts say children as young as 8 should get screened for anxiety.</strong></li><li><strong>Early detection of this condition can help children get treatment before symptoms become severe.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mental health issues continue to rise in all age groups, experts are recommending that all children should be screened for anxiety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anxiety is incredibly common and is diagnosed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childrensmentalhealth/data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9.4 percent of all US childrenTrusted Source</a>, or about 5.8 million children between ages 3 and 17.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is expected to make a finalized&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/draft-recommendation/screening-anxiety-children-adolescents" target="_blank">recommendation</a>&nbsp;that all children ages 8 to 18 years old should be screened for anxiety. The reason is that early intervention can prevent future anxiety disorders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the first recommendation urging the use of screening tools for children who may have anxiety and depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What parents should know</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This recommendation advises screening for anxiety in children regardless of if a clinician notices any signs or symptoms. This may help catch cases of anxiety before a child develops serious symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having the ability to screen patients at an early age allows providers and families to intervene as soon as possible.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/childhood-stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reports</a>&nbsp;show that those who develop anxiety at a young age are at an increased risk for substance misuse, adult anxiety, and depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.childrenshospitalvanderbilt.org/doctors/tanguturi-yasas-chandra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Yasas Tanguturi</a>, child and adolescent psychiatrist and assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the Monroe Carell Jr. Hospital at Vanderbilt, agrees that early detection of anxiety is important for two reasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The age of onset of these disorders is commonly in the elementary school age, making them the earliest psychiatric disorder to manifest during the lifespan. While fears and worries can be developmentally appropriate in this age group, it is important to identify when they become severe enough to impair day-to-day functioning,” Tanguturi tells Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also explained that anxiety tends to be co-mingled with other conditions, creating more complex illnesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Anxiety disorders are also highly comorbid- meaning those who have anxiety disorders have a higher risk for other psychiatric illness- both other anxiety disorders, but also things like mood disorders (depression specifically) as they enter adolescence.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although children of all ages can develop anxiety, this recommendation is for children 8 years and older as there is insufficient evidence for those under this age.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Essentially, that means we don’t know enough about younger children for the USPSTF to make an evidence-supported recommendation, but that doesn’t mean that younger children don’t also experience anxiety and need services at times,” says&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rampages.us/psychology/2016/09/29/alumna-spotlight-dr-raquel-halfond-ph-d-11/" target="_blank">Raquel Halfond</a>, PhD, Senior Director of Evidence Based Practice and Health Equity at the American Psychological Association.</p>

<h2><a>What to expect at the pediatrician’s office</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When children present to their primary doctor’s office, parents and patients are asked questions to understand underlying conditions and exposures. This is already done for things like lead exposure, age-appropriate milestones, and safety within the home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This screening could be done during regular check-ups with a pediatrician or other opportunities,” said Halfond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This screening would be an additional method of understanding and picking up anxiety in younger patients before they show the obvious or overt symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By focusing on these symptoms, clinicians will be able to continue to follow these trends or even intervene to provide resources and support to help prevent developing anxiety. The screening can be a conversation-starting point to express emotions before it is too late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Halfond believes this “will be important that children who screen positive are connected with care to receive a further assessment to confirm the diagnosis and then, once confirmed, that they receive evidence-based treatments.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is common for children to have some small degree of anxiety, and some experts even say that it can be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-anxiety-can-make-you-more-powerful">beneficial</a>&nbsp;as it forms a way of keeping one safe and aware of their surroundings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, outside of these momentary bouts of anxiety, persistent symptoms can begin to alter and affect a child’s everyday life. If strong and persistent enough, these can develop into complications later in life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Signs of anxiety in children</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your child has any of the following symptoms, they may be experiencing the early features of anxiety, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/The-Anxious-Child-047.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry</a>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Refusing to go to school</li><li>Frequent stomachaches and other physical complaints</li><li>Panic or tantrums at times of separation from parents</li><li>Low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence</li><li>Many worries about things before they happen</li><li>Avoidance of social situations</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experts point out that the pandemic has also exacerbated stressful situations for children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“While it does not seem like this is all related to the pandemic, the pandemic has certainly accelerated things and contributed to the full-blown crisis in mental health for children and adolescents,” said Tanguturi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although this is not a formal recommendation as of yet, the task force currently has a draft of its guidelines which is open to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/public-comments-and-nominations/opportunity-for-public-comment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public comment</a>, and will likely finalize the recommendation by the end of this year.</p>

<p>However, physical activity is also beneficial to the mental health of a child.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experts say physical activity allows children to have a better outlook on life by building confidence, managing anxiety and depression, and increasing self-esteem and cognitive skills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Exercise also releases endorphins, which correlates to a happy child,” said Len Saunders, physical health educator, and author of “Keeping Kids Fit” and “Buddy and Bea.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The benefits of physical activity for children are in the spotlight this week after two studies were published Monday in the journal Pediatrics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both analyzed the positive effects of exercise on children’s mental well-being.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.healio.com/psychiatry/depression/news/online/%7Be0ce29fd-c7dd-4de0-86b5-70a8da1c1eea%7D/exercise-may-prevent-depression-in-middle-childhood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One study</a>&nbsp;concluded that moderate to vigorous physical activity at ages 6 and 8 is linked to fewer symptoms of depression two years later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2017/01/05/peds.2016-1985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other study</a>&nbsp;concluded that cybercycling improves classroom functioning for children with behavioral disorders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cybercycling involves riding a stationary bike while looking at virtual reality scenery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So why cybercycling and not just cycling?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Children with behavioral health disorders (BHD) demonstrate low participation in aerobic exercise, and cybercycling was critical because the children found it engaging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In terms of the physiology, there is no reason to believe that any aerobic exercise — regular cycling, running, etc. – wouldn’t have these effects. But getting children to engage in it if they don’t enjoy it is very challenging,” April Bowling, assistant professor at Merrimack College, explained to Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of these children have sensory disorders, social anxiety, and delays in developing motor skills, so it’s difficult to make traditional sports and exercise programs attractive to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The cybercycling appealed to them because they could engage in it successfully at their current ability level, and they found the video games and virtual reality courses entertaining. When you are chasing dragons and collecting points, you can easily forget how hard you are working,” said Bowling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research shows exercise improves mood and behavior in children and lowers chronic disease risks, but there is little research on educational settings serving children with complex BHD, the study explained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By using a randomized controlled crossover design, researchers investigated whether an aerobic cybercycling physical education curriculum could successfully engage and improve behavioral regulation and classroom functioning among children and adolescents with complex BHD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students diagnosed with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, or mood disorders were randomly assigned to use the bikes twice a week during 30- to 40-minute physical education classes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers found the program to be successful as children gradually increased their riding time and intensity over seven weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Overall, children in the intervention group, who ranged in ages 7 to 16, displayed up to 51 percent less disruptive behaviors than during the control period, with the effect particularly strong on the days they participated in the cybercycling class,” the study reports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saunders was particularly interested in the cybercycling study as the visual stimulation acts as a great motivation to exercise. “I think the cybercycling study was wonderful. The children in the study were visually stimulated in a unique way that motivated them to exercise,” Saunders told Healthline. “It was something that was enjoyable to them, which was a nice reward at school. There appears to be a direct correlation between this type of exercise and improvement in behavioral health.”</p>

<h2><a>Changing the brain</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers believe that aerobic exercise acts in different ways that can help improve mood and behavior in children and adults.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“First, it seems to change where the brain directs its resources, from areas of the brain that are involved in worrying, for example, and toward areas that are more involved in coordination and focus,” said Bowling. “Secondly, aerobic exercise can change brain chemistry, and specifically the levels of certain neurotransmitters that might help improve an individual’s self-regulation. When mood and self-regulation — the ability to control behavior — is improved, then children can function better in the classroom.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowling believes there is a lot of promise for cybercycling to be used in more settings. She added they’re currently testing their use in public special education classrooms, but there’s a problem in getting these expensive bikes into schools that can’t afford them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Cost is an issue for many schools, and kids need access to different types of exercise, so I think an important area of research will be also testing other engaging modes of aerobic exercise that could be similarly effective but less expensive,” Bowling said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowling emphasized the study adds to mounting evidence that kids with behavioral health challenges benefit from exercise — not just physically, but mentally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think it’s absolutely critical that we stop cutting out movement from the school day — taking time away from recess and physical education for more academic purposes — if we want our children to perform to their potential,” said Bowling.</p>

<h2><a>Battling depression, anxiety</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other study focused on physical activity, sedentary behavior, and symptoms of major depression in middle childhood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Physical activity, and particularly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA], has a positive effect on reducing future depressive symptoms in middle childhood,” said Tonje Zahl, M.S.C., of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and the study’s lead author.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, increasing physical activity may serve as a complementary method in treating childhood depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Physical activity has a range of health benefits, and this study indicates that increasing children’s moderate and vigorous physical activity may prevent later depressive symptoms,” said Zahl in a statement. “Thus, increased physical activity may serve as an adjunct component to … pharmacological or psychological treatments. As regards prevention, because nearly all children can be targeted in efforts to increase MVPA, the gains at the population level might be substantial.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Physical educators agree that physical activity may prevent depressive symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Exercise has a positive effect on creating mentally healthy children by releasing feel-good brain chemicals that may ease depression,” said Saunders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Christina Hibbert, clinical psychologist, and author of “8 Keys to Mental Health Through Exercise,” believes in physical activity as a means of therapy. Exercise has helped her overcome depression and anxiety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Personally, I’ve used cardiovascular exercise to help me overcome struggles with depression, and strength training/flexibility exercises have helped me overcome anxiety,” Hibbert told Healthline. “Being in the sun, getting out of the house, and moving my body had a profound effect on my mood, and I started to see that it was key in helping me feel emotionally and mentally stronger and healthier.”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Other mental health conditions</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a psychologist, Hibbert teaches her clients how to use physical activity to not only prevent mental and physical illness, but also to help treat other conditions, including grief, heartache, bad moods, and even relationship and family problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m such a believer in the power of the mind-body-spirit connection,” Hibbert added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Physical activity is one of the best things we can do to ease the effects of most mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia,” Hibbert said. “Though adherence to an exercise program might be more challenging for those suffering from mental health conditions, if they can learn the mental skills to stay motivated and stick with it, regular exercise can be one of the most powerful additions to treatment,” she added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hibbert noted that the two studies are in-line with other research showing the powerful effects of exercise on the brain, behavior, and mental health. “When we move our body, we move our mind. That might mean moving excess mental energy that would otherwise lead to behavioral issues and disruption, or it might mean moving us out of a state of feeling depressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exercise not only offers the healthy calm energy we need for optimal behavior, it also allows us to work out stressful, anxious energy that may interfere with daily life,” she said. “Being active and moving our body daily can carry the incredible mental health benefits like greater mental clarity, energy, focus, creativity, insight, etc., into our teen and adult years,” said Hibbert.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Hibbert and Saunders agree that the younger we start exercising the better off we’ll be later on in life, and it’s never too late to start. They also urge parents to take part in their children’s physical activity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Adults that work with children play an important role in the growth and development of children. Being that ‘healthy role model’ will not only help them stay physically fit, but mentally fit,” said Saunders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One of the best ways to help our children be more active is to start a habit of activity ourselves and include our children,” added Hibbert. “Play, ride bikes, jump on the trampoline together with your child — whatever you can do to get your children — and you — moving, and make it fun, is going to be just right. This shows children that moving is fun, it makes them feel good, and it also strengthens our family bonds.”</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal mood disorder said to affect millions of Americans during the fall and winter seasons.</strong></li><li><strong>It can manifest as low mood, low energy, feelings of anxiety, and excessive daytime sleepiness.</strong></li><li><strong>SAD may be more prevalent this year due to the after-effects of the pandemic and a period of increased worry</strong>.</li><li><strong>Healthcare providers can treat more severe cases of SAD.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While fall brings about colorful leaves and cooler weather, it can also cause seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of recurrent depression that tends to come and go with the seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite its acronym, SAD is more than simply feeling sad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also called seasonal depression or winter depression, SAD usually starts in the late fall or early winter and typically subsides by spring and summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/seasonal-affective-disorder/index.shtml" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health (NIH)Trusted Source</a>, the following factors can increase your risk for SAD:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>being female</li><li>being a young adult</li><li>having a family history of depression</li><li>having a personal history of depression or bipolar disorder</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Identifying the symptoms of SAD</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2019/seasonal-affective-disorder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a>&nbsp;that approximately 10 million Americans experience SAD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to social withdrawal, the NIH indicates that other common signs and symptoms of SAD include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>low energy</li><li>excessive sleepiness (hypersomnia)</li><li>overeating</li><li>weight gain</li><li>craving for carbohydrates</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The signs and symptoms of SAD are similar to those of depression because SAD is a form of depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The key to identifying SAD is the distinct seasonal onset and spontaneous remission of symptoms throughout a season,” says psychotherapist<a href="https://www.heatherdarwallsmith.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Heather Darwall-Smith</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“SAD is known to have a greater prevalence in countries with greater northern latitude where there are fewer daylight hours – the further you are from the equator, the higher the risk.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, there’s a chance the disorder could affect more people for the first time in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the toll the outbreak has taken on global mental health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Many people experienced symptoms of depression during the lockdown as our activities were curtailed and we were isolated more,” points out&nbsp;<a href="https://ginlalli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gin Lalli</a>, a solutions-focused psychotherapist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As lockdown lifted, we felt better for a short while, but we’ve not really had enough time to process what happened. The change in season may add ‘another layer’ to previously mild symptoms. People who felt they were coping before may now feel overwhelmed.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, Darwall-Smith believes many people are currently experiencing “increased worry” around topics such as the economy and climate change. In her opinion, this can affect your mood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite its prevalence, it’s not entirely clear what causes SAD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It has been hypothesized that SAD occurs due to changes in how the body produces melatonin, a hormone that controls your sleep cycle,” says Darwall-Smith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The overproduction of this hormone can cause excessive sleepiness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Certain neurotransmitters have also been implicated, and SAD has been linked with dysfunction in the serotonin system, which can result in a low mood,” she adds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The good news is there are many ways you can manage the disorder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Online therapy can help with depression</p>

<h2><a>How to prevent and treat SAD</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’ve experienced SAD in the past, have a history of depression or depressive disorders, or have experienced increased stresses and major life changes, Dayry Hulkow, primary therapist at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vistapineshealth.com/" target="_blank">Vista Pines Health</a>, a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.delphihealthgroup.com/" target="_blank">Delphi Behavioral Health Group</a>&nbsp;facility, says to make practicing self-care a priority this fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Emotional disturbances may or may not always be prevented. However, there are many preventive measures that can help safeguard our mental health and well-being. Things such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and adequate sleep are always important aspects of daily self-care practices,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hulkow added that “maintaining meaningful connections with close family and friends can help prevent or minimize the prevalence of SAD, as well as other mental health conditions.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.mhanational.org/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental Health America</a>&nbsp;states that increasing your amount of light at home, spending more time outside, and visiting climates that have more sun are also forms of prevention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to preventive measures, Psychotherapist and founder of Cultureminds Therapy&nbsp;<a href="https://culturemindstherapy.com/about-sharnade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sharnade George</a>&nbsp;says to think of preparation like you might for the flu season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Before the winter seasons, we normally buy our medicines or natural resources and prepare ourselves to take extra care of our immune system so when winter arrives, we already have taken the right safety measures to prevent any flu or cold. This can also be implemented for people who suffer with SAD [by] ensuring [they have safety measures in place that] relate to their symptoms,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best form of preparation may be connecting with a mental health professional who can determine the appropriate treatment for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treatment might include vitamin D supplementation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and medications, such as antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Light therapy is also helpful for some people. It involves sitting in front of a light therapy box that emits bright light while filtering out ultraviolet rays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the American Psychological Association, light therapy typically involves sitting in front of the box for at least 20 minutes a day in the morning during the fall and winter months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health experts say the earlier the intervention, the better, as it helps to decrease the impact on an individual’s physical and emotional well-being.</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>A new study has found a link between meatless diets and depressive episodes.</strong></li><li><strong>People who did not eat meat were depressed about two times as often.</strong></li><li><strong>It was not possible to determine whether this was due to nutritional deficiencies.</strong></li><li><strong>Nutritionists say certain nutrients may be more difficult to obtain on a meatless diet.</strong></li><li><strong>However, meatless diets can be nutritionally adequate with good planning.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to a new study published this month in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032722010643#ab0005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Affective Disorders</a>, vegetarians experienced depressive episodes twice as often as those who ate meat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/vegetarian-and-special-diets/vegetarianism-the-basic-facts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a>&nbsp;explains that vegetarianism is defined in various ways, with some people opting to still consume dairy and/or eggs. However, the common thread in all forms of vegetarianism is the avoidance of meat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vegans, on the other hand, do not eat any animal products at all, including honey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many reasons that people choose to eat a meatless diet, including ethical considerations, concern for the environment, religious beliefs, and health benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Investigating the link between meatless diets and depression</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The survey looked at 14,216 people in Brazil between the ages of 35 to 74. A food frequency questionnaire was used to determine whether people followed a meatless diet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A diagnostic tool called the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) was used to determine whether people had episodes of depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers found, upon analysis of the data, that meatless diets were associated with twice the frequency of depressive episodes. Further, this association was independent of socioeconomic factors as well as lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity levels, and body mass index (BMI). The exact reason for these findings is unclear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/mary-mosquera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary Mosquera-Cochran</a>, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center who was not a part of the study, said that due to the way the study was designed — analyzing data rather than conducting a controlled experiment — it can’t be concluded whether a meatless diet actually does cause depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The researchers found that diet quality was somewhat associated with higher rates of depression, but it did not fully explain the association,” said Cochran.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She further explained that the researchers hypothesized that this link might exist because people who are depressed are more likely to try dietary changes (like cutting out meat, for example) because they are hoping to feel better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cochran said that the study was done on Brazilian citizens, so it also may not apply to other populations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She additionally pointed out the fact that it was only a very small percentage of people in the sample studied were actually vegetarians — 82 people out of around 14,000 total.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The authors note that it’s currently estimated that 5-14% of Brazilians currently follow a vegetarian style diet, so this sample may not be reflective of all vegetarians in Brazil either,” said Cochran.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Why might meatless diets cause depression?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though the authors also note that they adjusted for factors like protein and micronutrient intake, concluding that they believe “nutrient deficiencies do not explain this association,” other experts disagree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics spokesperson&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/media/meet-our-spokespeople/spokespeople/monique-richard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monique Richard</a>, said meatless diets and depression could be linked for a variety of reasons, with one being nutrient deficiencies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Whenever an individual excludes an entire food group, in this case, protein and fat sources, and does not replace it with equally nutritionally-adequate options, it will affect a variety of systemic and physiological functions such as cognitive health,” she said, noting that it is important to look deeper into the dietary patterns of these individuals to learn whether this might have been the case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If an individual does not have an adequate intake of nutrients such as B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein, certain enzymes and proteins may be compromised, altering specific pathways in the body,” said Richard. “This could affect mood, anxiety, memory, perceived stress, sleep, etc.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an example, she cites the amino acid tryptophan, which is needed to make serotonin, an important neurotransmitter that has been linked to mood disorders like depression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tryptophan is found in meat as well as oats, nuts, and seeds, explained Richard. But it’s important that people are educated on what foods contain it and how to consume enough to meet their own personal needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Other factors that would be important to assess would be if the person felt isolated or disconnected from others related to their dietary choice,” said Richard. “Is there a personal, religious, or moral consideration for the choice that may also be contributing to these feelings and state of mind?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>How to get adequate nutrition on a meatless diet</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/health-and-human-services/programs/department-of-public-and-allied-health/dietetics/faculty/mary-jon-ludy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mary-Jon Ludy</a>, Chair of the Department of Public and Allied Health and Associate Professor of Food and Nutrition at Bowling Green State University, advised that “[w]ith or without meat, it is important to follow a healthy, high quality eating pattern that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Eating a variety of nutrient-dense foods as well as limiting added sugars, solid fats, and sodium is key,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/samantha-coogan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samantha Coogan</a>, Program Director of the Didactic Program in Nutrition and Dietetics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, the main vitamins and minerals of concern when it comes to depression are the B vitamins, zinc, magnesium, and selenium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vitamin B12, in particular, is only found in animal products, said Coogan. However, it, along with other B complex vitamins, are responsible for mood regulation and brain function.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“B vitamins can be found in fortified breakfast cereals, and B12 in fish, eggs, meat, and milk products,” she said. Additionally, most people who don’t eat meat will need to take a B12 supplement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She further notes that a B complex supplement may be a better option since you’ll get the amount of B12 that you need along with the other B vitamins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Zinc may play a role in endocrine pathways that may lead to increased levels of cortisol, and the regulation of neurotransmission as a potential mechanism of action, so a deficiency could disrupt usual neurotransmitter firing/signaling to other areas of the body, such as elevating the expression of the hippocampus and decreasing cortisol,” explained Coogan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She noted that zinc is mainly found in red meat, crab, and oysters, making it difficult for a vegan or vegetarian to get enough. However, it can also be found in nuts, whole grains, fortified cereals, and dairy products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coogan further explained that magnesium is responsible for the activation of more than 300 enzyme systems that play important roles in brain function.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Low magnesium can lead to inflammation, dysregulation of oxidative pathways possibly inducing oxidative stress, and may dysregulate the release of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, and sleep cycles (i.e. interrupting sleep/insomnia),” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, when it comes to getting enough magnesium, plant eaters are in luck, according to Coogan. This important mineral is found mostly in plant-based foods, including leafy greens, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, selenium deficiency can cause thyroid dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulation of important mood regulators like serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Selenium is primarily found in seafood, poultry, meat, eggs, and fish,” said Coogan. However, it can also be found in bread and grains.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ludy concluded by stating, “If in doubt, meeting with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) can be a great resource for planning a well-balanced diet.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
