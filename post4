<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The band Coldplay&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coldplay.com/postponement-of-brazil-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;on Oct. 4 that it had to postpone upcoming shows in Brazil because its lead singer, Chris Martin, has a “serious lung infection” and is under doctor’s orders to rest for three weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lung infection is a type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nm.org/conditions-and-care-areas/pulmonary/respiratory-infection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lower respiratory tract infection</a>&nbsp;and can result in symptoms such as congestion, cough and difficulty breathing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Although many people get better on their own, sometimes a lung infection can be severe enough to require a person to be hospitalized.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“While upper respiratory tract infections can also impact people, lower respiratory infections are really where the threat of significant complications and death can occur,” said Dr.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/doctors-departments/providers/physicians/david-a-beuther" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David A. Beuther</a>, a pulmonologist and associate professor at National Jewish Health in Denver.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>Common types of respiratory infections</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One type of lower respiratory tract infection that many people are aware of is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pneumonia/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pneumoniaTrusted Source</a>, an infection in the lungs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before antibiotics were available, bacterial pneumonia killed many people, said Beuther. “But even today with antibiotics, this kind of infection can [worsen],” he said, “particularly in older, very young or vulnerable people.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pneumonia can also be caused by viruses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a long time, the “most common and deadly” type of viral pneumonia was caused by the influenza virus, said Beuther, but now it is due to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There are also times when a person can get a viral pneumonia, and then a secondary bacterial pneumonia” on top of that, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another common lower respiratory tract infection is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/bronchitis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute bronchitisTrusted Source</a>, an inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thomasyadegarmd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas Yadegar</a>, a pulmonologist and medical director of the ICU at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center, said there’s quite a bit of overlap between the symptoms of pneumonia and acute bronchitis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With acute bronchitis, people may have a cough, low-grade fever, body aches, weakness, and tiredness. “These are all symptoms you can get with pneumonia, as well,” said Yadegar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he said people with pneumonia may also feel pain when they take a deep breath or cough; and they typically have a high-grade fever, 103°F or higher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One other thing that differentiates the two types of infections is that “with bronchitis, people for the most part can go about their daily activities,” he said. Whereas with pneumonia, they feel run down, have a lack of energy, and may lose their appetite, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Some people at greater risk</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lower respiratory tract infections can occur in anyone, but some people are at greater risk of severe illness and may have a harder time recovering.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We certainly worry about people who are impaired in some way,” said Beuther.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said this includes infants and newborn babies — particularly premature babies, whose immune system is still developing — and those over age 65.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, people whose immune system is compromised, either because of a medical condition or a medication that suppresses the immune system, are at higher risk of severe lung infections, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some underlying medical conditions also put people at greater risk, including lung disease, said Dr.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/fady-youssef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fady Youssef</a>, a pulmonologist, internist, and critical care specialist at MemorialCare Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, California.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That group would include patients with asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung disease or lung cancer — any disease that decreases the ability of the lung to fight an infection,” or affects the ability of the lung to take in air, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked about Coldplay’s Chris Martin, Beuther said being a professional singer isn’t a particular risk factor for severe lower respiratory tract infections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Anybody, even a young, completely healthy person can get pneumonia,” he said. “I’ve even seen young, healthy people die of pneumonia. This still happens despite good care.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, being run-down, under a lot of stress, and not getting enough sleep can increase the risk of developing pneumonia, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Your immune system can be somewhat compromised just by overextending yourself, being overtired, and not eating properly,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But being rundown isn’t something experienced only by rock band musicians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We see this in athletes who have overtrained, for example, or even new parents who are not sleeping well with their new baby at home,” said Beuther.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>Preventing severe lung infections</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Youssef said the majority of people who get a viral respiratory tract infection improve on their own with supportive care, such as rest, drinking fluids, and eating healthy foods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, “if within a two-day window, you’re not improving, then you should definitely seek medical attention,” said Yadegar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People whose infection is due to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 may want to seek medical care as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may be eligible for medications — Paxlovid or Lagevrio — that may reduce your risk of severe illness. These&nbsp;<a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov/TestToTreat/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatments</a>&nbsp;work best when started within 5 days after the start of symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are also other things you can do to reduce your risk of severe illness from lower respiratory tract infections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Vaccination remains an important way to defend yourself against [certain types of] pneumonia,” said Beuther. “One of the most deadly is called pneumococcal pneumonia, and we have vaccines that protect against that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommendsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;this vaccine for people 65 years or older, as well as for younger adults, teenagers, and children with certain medical conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In addition, getting the flu shot every year can dramatically reduce your risk of dying of influenza pneumonia,” said Beuther.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And “if people haven’t had at least three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, they are not doing what they can to protect themselves from viral pneumonia caused by the coronavirus,” he said.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lung infection can be caused by a virus, bacteria, and sometimes even a fungus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most common types of lung infections is called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. Pneumonia, which affects the smaller air sacs of the lungs, is most often caused by contagious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bacterial-pneumonia">bacteria</a>, but can also be caused by a virus. A person becomes infected by breathing in the bacteria or virus after a nearby infected person sneezes or coughs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>How infections occur</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the large bronchial tubes that carry air to and from your lungs become infected, it’s referred to as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bronchitis">bronchitis</a>. Bronchitis is more likely to be caused by a virus than by bacteria.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Viruses can also attack the lungs or the air passages that lead to the lungs. This is called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bronchiolitis">bronchiolitis</a>. Viral bronchiolitis most commonly occurs in infants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lung infections like pneumonia are usually mild, but they can be serious, especially for people with weakened immune systems or chronic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Read on to learn the most common symptoms of a lung infection and what treatment you can expect if you have one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Symptoms</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The symptoms of a lung infection vary from mild to severe. This depends on several factors, including your age and overall health, and whether the infection is caused by a virus, bacteria, or fungus. Symptoms may be similar to those of a cold or flu, but they tend to last longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a lung infection, here are the most common symptoms to expect:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Cough that produces thick mucus</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coughing helps to rid your body of the mucus produced from inflammation of the airways and lungs. This mucus may also contain blood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With bronchitis or pneumonia, you may have a cough that produces thick mucus that may have a distinct color, including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>clear</li><li>white</li><li>green</li><li>yellowish-grey</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A cough can linger for several weeks even after other symptoms have improved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Stabbing chest pains</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/symptom/chest-pain">Chest pain</a>&nbsp;caused by a lung infection is often described as sharp or stabbing. The chest pain tends to worsen while coughing or breathing deeply. Sometimes the sharp pains can be felt in your mid to upper back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Fever</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/symptom/fever">fever</a>&nbsp;occurs as your body tries to fight off the infection. Normal body temperature is typically around 98.6°F (37°C).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a bacterial lung infection, your fever may rise as high as a dangerous 105°F (40.5°C).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any high fever above 102°F (38.9°C) often results in many other symptoms, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>sweating</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/symptom/chills">chills</a></li><li>muscle aches</li><li>dehydration</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/headache">headache</a></li><li>weakness</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should see a doctor if your fever goes above 102°F (38.9°C) or if it lasts more than three days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Body aches</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your muscles and back may ache when you have a lung infection. This is called myalgia. Sometimes you can develop inflammation in your muscles which can also lead to body aches when you have an infection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Runny nose</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A runny nose and other flu-like symptoms, such as sneezing, often accompany a lung infection like bronchitis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Shortness of breath</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/symptom/shortness-of-breath">Shortness of breath</a>&nbsp;means that you feel like breathing is difficult or that you can’t breathe in completely. You should see a doctor right away if you’re having trouble breathing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. Fatigue</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’ll usually feel sluggish and tired as your body fights off an infection. Rest is crucial during this time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. Wheezing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you exhale, you might hear a high-pitched whistling sound known as wheezing. This is the result narrowed airways or inflammation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. Bluish appearance of the skin or lips</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your lips or nails may start to appear slightly blue in color due to lack of oxygen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>10. Crackling or rattling sounds in the lungs</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the telltale signs of a lung infection is a crackling sound in the base of the lungs, also known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bibasilar-crackles">bibasilar crackles</a>. A doctor can hear these sounds using a tool called a stethoscope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Causes</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bronchitis, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis are three types of lung infections. They are typically caused by a virus or bacteria.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most common microorganisms responsible for bronchitis include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>viruses such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/flu">influenza</a>&nbsp;virus or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv">respiratory syncytial virus</a>&nbsp;(RSV)</li><li>bacteria such as&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>,&nbsp;<em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Bordetella pertussis</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most common microorganisms responsible for pneumonia include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>bacteria such as&nbsp;<em>Streptococcus pneumonia</em>&nbsp;(most common),&nbsp;<em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mycoplasma-pneumonia">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</a></em></li><li>viruses such as the influenza virus or RSV</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rarely, lung infections can be caused by fungi such as&nbsp;<em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em>,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/aspergillosis">Aspergillus</a></em>, or&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/histoplasmosis">Histoplasma capsulatum</a></em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fungal lung infection is more common in people who are immunosuppressed, either from certain types of cancer or HIV or from taking immunosuppressive medications.</p>

<h2><a>Diagnosis</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A doctor will first take a medical history and ask about your symptoms. You may be asked questions about your occupation, recent travel, or exposure to animals. The doctor will measure your temperature and listen to your chest with a stethoscope to check for crackling sounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other common ways to diagnose a lung infection include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>imaging, such as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/chest-x-ray">chest X-ray</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/ct-scan">CT scan</a></li><li>spirometry, a tool that measures how much and how quickly you take in air with each breath</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pulse-oximetry">pulse oximetry</a>&nbsp;to measure the level of oxygen in your blood</li><li>taking a sample of mucus or nasal discharge for further testing</li><li>throat swab</li><li>complete blood count (CBC)</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/blood-culture">blood culture</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Treatments</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A bacterial infection usually requires antibiotics in order to clear it up. A fungal lung infection will require treatment with an antifungal medication, such as ketoconazole or voriconazole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antibiotics won’t work on viral infections. Most of the time, you’ll have to wait until your body fights off the infection on its own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the meantime, you can help your body fight off the infection and make yourself more comfortable with the following home care remedies:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce your fever</li><li>drink lots of water</li><li>try hot tea with honey or ginger</li><li>gargle salt water</li><li>rest as much as possible</li><li>use a humidifier to create moisture in the air</li><li>take any prescribed antibiotic until it’s gone</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For more severe lung infections, you may need to stay at a hospital during your recovery. During your stay, you may receive antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and respiratory therapy if you’re having difficulty breathing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>When to see a doctor</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lung infections can be serious if not treated. In general, see a doctor if your cough lasts more than three weeks, or you’re having trouble breathing. You can book an appointment with a doctor in your area using our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/find-care/specialty/primary-care-doctors?utm_source=healthline&amp;utm_medium=in-text&amp;utm_content=/health/symptoms-of-lung-infection&amp;utm_k1=otherrespiratory&amp;utm_text=healthline_findcare_tool">Healthline FindCare tool</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fever can mean different things depending on your age. In general, you should follow these guidelines:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Infants</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See a doctor if your infant is:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>younger than 3 months, with a temperature exceeding 100.4°F (38°C)</li><li>between 3 and 6 months, with a fever above 102°F (38.9°C) and seems unusually irritable, lethargic, or uncomfortable</li><li>between 6 and 24 months, with a fever over 102°F (38.9°C) for more than 24 hours</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Children</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See a doctor if your child:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>has a fever above 102.2°F (38.9°C)</li><li>is listless or irritable, vomits repeatedly, or has a severe headache</li><li>has had a fever for more than three days</li><li>has a serious medical illness or a compromised immune system</li><li>has recently been to a developing country</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Adults</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should make an appointment to see a doctor if you:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>have a body temperature over 103°F (39.4°C)</li><li>have had a fever for more than three days</li><li>have a serious medical illness or a compromised immune system</li><li>have recently been to a developing country</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should also seek emergency treatment at the nearest emergency room or call 911 if a fever is accompanied by any of the following symptoms:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>mental confusion</li><li>trouble breathing</li><li>stiff neck</li><li>chest pain</li><li>seizures</li><li>persistent vomiting</li><li>unusual skin rash</li><li>hallucinations</li><li>inconsolable crying in children</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a weakened immune system and develop a fever, shortness of breath, or a cough that brings up blood, seek emergency medical care right away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Prevention</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not all lung infections can be prevented, but you can minimize your risk with the following tips:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>wash your hands regularly</li><li>avoid touching your face or mouth</li><li>avoid sharing utensils, food, or drinks with other people</li><li>avoid being in crowded places where a virus can be easily spread</li><li>don’t smoke tobacco</li><li>get a flu shot every year to prevent influenza infection</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those at greater risk, the best way to prevent bacterial pneumonia from the most common strains of bacteria is with one of two vaccines:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</li><li>PPSV23 pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These vaccines are recommended for:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>infants</li><li>older adults</li><li>people who smoke</li><li>those with chronic health conditions</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>The bottom line</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lung infection causes symptoms similar to the cold or flu, but may be more severe and typically last longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your immune system will typically be able to clear a viral lung infection over time. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial lung infections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See your doctor right away if you have:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>difficulty breathing</li><li>a bluish color in your lips or fingertips</li><li>severe chest pain</li><li>a high fever</li><li>cough with mucus that is getting worse</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People older than 65, children under the age of 2, and people with chronic health conditions or a compromised immune system should seek medical treatment right away if they experience any symptoms of a lung infection.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’re coughing, you’ve got a fever, and your chest feels like it’s clogged with mucus. Do you have bronchitis or pneumonia? Both are lung infections with similar symptoms, so it can be hard to tell the difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The big difference between these two conditions — and you might not be able to feel it — is which part of the respiratory system is affected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Bronchitis</strong>&nbsp;affects the bronchial tubes that carry air to your lungs.</li><li><strong>Pneumonia</strong>&nbsp;affects the air sacs, called alveoli, where oxygen passes into your blood. Pneumonia causes these air sacs in the lungs to fill with fluid or pus.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, bronchitis comes in two forms:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Acute bronchitis.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bronchitis">Acute bronchitis</a>&nbsp;is an infection caused by viruses and sometimes bacteria.</li><li><strong>Chronic bronchitis.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/understanding-chronic-bronchitis">Chronic bronchitis</a>&nbsp;is a long-term inflammation in your lungs.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, bronchitis can turn into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pneumonia">pneumonia</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a>What are the primary similarities and differences?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be difficult to tell bronchitis and pneumonia apart based on congestion and cough alone. However, these two conditions have very different causes, symptoms, and treatments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The big difference in symptoms involves severity. Pneumonia symptoms are usually more severe than bronchitis, and pneumonia usually looks more like a body-wide infection with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fever">fever</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/chills">chills</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both pneumonia and bronchitis can develop from bacteria or viruses that cause respiratory infections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bronchitis is limited to the bronchial tubes that bring air to your lungs, while pneumonia develops and worsens deeper in your lung tissues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, pneumonia can also be caused by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fungal-infection">fungal infections</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/aspiration-pneumonia">aspiration</a>&nbsp;(inhaling something, like food or saliva, into your lungs).</p>

<h2><a>Bronchitis: Symptoms, causes, and treatment</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bronchitis is a condition that mostly affects the upper airway. Caused by infection or irritation, acute bronchitis can usually resolve on its own over the course of a few weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both bronchitis and pneumonia cause a cough that sometimes produces&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/green-phlegm">phlegm</a>, a thick type of mucus that’s made in your chest. You can tell the difference between bronchitis and pneumonia by checking for other symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Symptoms of bronchitis</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The symptoms of bronchitis depend on whether it’s acute or chronic. Simply stated, acute bronchitis will go away over several weeks and is usually caused by an infection. Chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, is a long-term condition caused by repeated exposure to chemicals or irritants like cigarette smoke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Acute bronchitis</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Symptoms of acute bronchitis are very similar to those of an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/acute-upper-respiratory-infection">upper respiratory infection</a>, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>fatigue</li><li>sore throat</li><li>runny nose</li><li>stuffed nose</li><li>fever</li><li>chills</li><li>body aches</li><li>mild headache</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you cough, you might also notice that your phlegm looks green or yellow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Acute bronchitis symptoms usually get better within a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-does-bronchitis-last">few days</a>, but the cough can stick around for a few weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Chronic bronchitis</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, causes a persistent cough that often lasts for at least 3 months. You might also feel that your cough goes through cycles of getting better and worse. When it gets worse, it’s known as a flare-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chronic bronchitis is part of a group of conditions called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/copd">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</a>. COPD also includes chronic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/emphysema-stages">emphysema</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/asthma">asthma</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additional symptoms of COPD, including chronic bronchitis, are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>shortness of breath</li><li>wheezing</li><li>fatigue</li><li>chest discomfort</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What causes bronchitis?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a virus. In less than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152497/#:~:text=Mycoplasma%20pneumoniae%2C%20C.,in%20perhaps%2010%25%20of%20cases.&amp;text=Cough%20caused%20by%20these%20agents,some%20cases%20for%20several%20months." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 percentTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;of cases, it’s caused by bacteria.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In both viral and bacterial bronchitis, germs enter the bronchial tubes of your lungs and cause irritation. Sometimes, a cold or other respiratory infection turns into bronchitis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chronic bronchitis is caused by frequent exposure to things that irritate your lungs, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>cigarette smoke</li><li>polluted air</li><li>dust</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As with many types of respiratory infections, some people are at a higher risk of developing bronchitis than others. High-risk groups for bronchitis include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>smokers</li><li>people who work with harmful fumes or chemicals</li><li>people with lung or respiratory diseases</li><li>older adults</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How is bronchitis treated?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How bronchitis is treated depends on whether it’s acute bronchitis or chronic bronchitis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Acute bronchitis may be treated with:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-do-antibiotics-work">antibiotics</a></li><li>antiviral medications</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/otc-anti-inflammatories">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a></li><li>steroids</li><li>supportive care like rest and fluids</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even with no prescription treatment, acute bronchitis should resolve in a few weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chronic bronchitis treatment can require lifestyle changes like quitting smoking and possibly making changes to your workplace or home environments. As chronic bronchitis progresses over time,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/treatment-options">treatments</a>&nbsp;may include things like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/understanding-chronic-bronchitis#treatments">bronchodilators</a></li><li>mucolytics</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/oxygen-therapy">oxygen therapy</a></li><li>pulmonary rehabilitation</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Taking care of yourself is the best medicine</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regardless of whether you have acute bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, or some form of pneumonia, supportive care can help you recover.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Follow these tips to speed up your healing time:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Get plenty of rest.</li><li>Drink plenty of fluids to loosen up the mucus in your lungs. Water, clear juices, or broths are the best choices. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can be dehydrating.</li><li>Take an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/otc-anti-inflammatories">over-the-counter anti-inflammatory</a>&nbsp;medication to reduce a fever and soothe body aches.</li><li>Turn on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/humidifiers-and-health">humidifier</a>&nbsp;to loosen up the mucus in your lungs.</li><li>Ask your doctor about using an over-the-counter cough remedy if your cough is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coughing-at-night">keeping you up</a>&nbsp;at night or making it hard to sleep.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Pneumonia: Symptoms, causes, and treatment</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think of pneumonia as a clog in your lungs’ plumbing. There are tiny air sacs in your lungs called alveoli. These thin, delicate sacs transfer oxygen from the air you breathe into your blood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When they are weighed down with fluid or mucus, these sacs can’t expand and contract well. This can reduce how well they move oxygen into your blood and other waste materials out of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Symptoms of pneumonia</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pneumonia also usually comes with a cough that sometimes produces yellow or green phlegm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other symptoms of pneumonia include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>fatigue</li><li>fever, which may be as high as 105°F (40.5°C)</li><li>shaking chills</li><li>chest pain, especially when you breathe deeply or cough</li><li>sweating</li><li>nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</li><li>shortness of breath</li><li>confusion, especially in older adults</li><li>blue lips from lack of oxygen</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pneumonia symptoms can range from mild to severe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What causes pneumonia?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pneumonia usually results from a virus, bacteria, or fungi. Inhaling irritants can also cause it. When these germs or irritants enter the alveoli in your lungs, you can develop pneumonia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several types of pneumonia, depending on the underlying cause:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Bacterial pneumonia.</strong>&nbsp;This is caused by bacteria. The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pneumonia/what-causes-pneumonia.html" target="_blank">most common</a>&nbsp;type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bacterial-pneumonia">bacterial pneumonia</a>&nbsp;is called pneumococcal pneumonia, which is caused by the&nbsp;<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>&nbsp;bacteria.</li><li><strong>Viral pneumonia.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/viral-pneumonia">Viral pneumonia</a>&nbsp;is caused by a virus, such as the influenza virus.</li><li><strong>Mycoplasma pneumonia.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mycoplasma-pneumonia">Mycoplasma pneumonia</a>&nbsp;is caused by tiny organisms called&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma</em>&nbsp;that have characteristics of both viruses and bacteria.</li><li><strong>Fungal pneumonia</strong>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pneumonia#types-and-causes">Fungal pneumonia</a>&nbsp;is caused by fungi, such as&nbsp;<em>Pneumocystis jiroveci</em>.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone can develop pneumonia, but there are some people who are at a higher risk. These include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>smokers</li><li>people over age 65</li><li>people with certain medical conditions that can weaken the lungs or immune system</li><li>people who have difficulty swallowing</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How pneumonia is treated</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pneumonia is treated by addressing the source of the infection. Antibiotics may be used to treat a bacterial cause, while antivirals may be used for viral infections like influenza. If the cause of your pneumonia is fungal, a combination of antifungals and antibiotics may be used.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In severe cases, you may require hospitalization, supplemental oxygen, or more invasive treatments like mechanical ventilation to help your alveoli function while your pneumonia resolves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>How bronchitis and pneumonia are diagnosed</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your doctor can use the same techniques to diagnose both bronchitis and pneumonia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start, they’ll ask about your symptoms, including when they started and how severe they are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, they’ll likely use a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/auscultation">stethoscope</a>&nbsp;to listen to your lungs as you breathe. Crackling, bubbling, whistling, or rattling&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/breath-sounds">sounds</a>&nbsp;could be signs that you have either bronchitis or pneumonia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depending on your symptoms, they may do some additional testing, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Sputum culture.</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/routine-sputum-culture">sputum culture</a>&nbsp;involves taking a sample of the phlegm you cough up and analyzing it for specific germs.</li><li><strong>Chest X-rays.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/chest-x-ray">Chest X-rays</a>&nbsp;can help your doctor see where the infection is in your lungs, which can help them distinguish between bronchitis and pneumonia.</li><li><strong>Pulse oximetry.</strong>&nbsp;For a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pulse-oximetry">pulse oximetry</a>&nbsp;test, your doctor attaches a clip to your finger to measure the amount of oxygen in your blood.</li><li><strong>Pulmonary function tests.</strong>&nbsp;In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/copd-and-asthma/pulmonary-function-tests">pulmonary function test</a>, your doctor has you blow into a device called a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/spirometry">spirometer</a>, which measures how much air your lungs can hold and how forcefully you can blow that air out.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>When to see a doctor</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you feel like you have either bronchitis or pneumonia, it’s always a good idea to check in with your doctor. If the underlying cause is bacterial, you should start feeling much better within a day or two of starting antibiotics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Otherwise, call your doctor if your coughing or wheezing doesn’t improve after 2 weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should also seek immediate medical care if you notice:</p>

<h1>Study: Pneumonia Vaccine Effective in Adults Over 65</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pfizer pneumonia vaccine is effective in elderly people, a new study finds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In one of the largest vaccine trials ever, Pfizer has reported that its pneumonia vaccine Prevnar 13 is effective at preventing the condition in elderly people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next month, Pfizer will spill the beans on its Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA) study, which tested the vaccine’s efficacy. The study encompassed about 85,000 people over the age of 65 to see how well the vaccine works. The results, researchers say, are promising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/pneumonia.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTrusted Source</a>, 62.3 percent of adults over 65 have never had a pneumonia vaccine. In 2010, there were 1.1 million people discharged from hospitals who had the condition, and they stayed an average of 5.2 days at medical centers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An estimated 300,000 adults aged 50 and older are hospitalized every year because of pneumococcal pneumonia, a substantial cause of illness and death, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/tech-new-device-detects-pneumonia-with-a-microphone-070313"><strong>What’s in a Cough? New Method Detects Pneumonia Using Only a Microphone »</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>Vaccine Effective in Older Adults</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main goal of the study was to see how well Prevnar 13 works against a first episode of vaccine-type community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). It also was effective against a first episode of non-bacteremic/non-invasive vaccine-type CAP, or VT-CAP, and a first episode of vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The study is the largest double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a vaccine ever conducted in adults.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are pleased with the outcome of the CAPiTA study, which demonstrated that Prevnar 13 can prevent vaccine-type pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia in adults,” Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research, said in a press release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>What is Prevnar 13?</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2009, the vaccine was introduced for use in infants and young children in Europe. It’s now allowed in more than 120 countries across the globe. Prevnar 13 is approved for use in adults 50 years of age and older in more than 90 countries, and is also approved in the U.S. and European Union (EU) for use in older children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prevnar 13 was licensed by the FDA under an accelerated approval process to address an unmet medical need in older adults. As a requirement of the accelerated approval pathway, Pfizer conducted CAPiTA to verify clinical benefit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prevnar 13 is also known as Prevenar 13, its name in many overseas markets.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>What Does This Mean?</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The announcement means that there hopefully will be fewer cases of pneumonia since adults can be effectively protected from it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Pneumococcal pneumonia is a significant cause of illness and death in adults around the world, and the potential to reduce the burden of this disease through direct vaccination of adults represents a meaningful public health benefit,” Dr. Emilio A. Emini, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine research and development, said. “Pfizer looks forward to sharing the CAPiTA data with U.S. and worldwide regulatory authorities and vaccine technical committees, to help inform decisions regarding potential Prevnar 13 label and recommendation updates.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Information on the study will be presented on March 12 at the 9th International Symposium on Pneumococci and Pneumococcal Diseases in Hyderabad, India.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria and viruses typically cause pneumonia. Fungi can also cause some types of pneumonia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pneumonia affects&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dotw/pneumonia/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of peopleTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;around the world each year. In the United States, about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430749/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25 of every 10,000 peopleTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;get pneumonia each year. That rate gets higher as age increases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people develop a serious case of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pneumonia">pneumonia</a>&nbsp;while in the hospital. But it’s more common to develop pneumonia outside a hospital setting. When this happens, doctors refer to it as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CAP is the&nbsp;<a href="https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(17)30916-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most common</a>&nbsp;type of pneumonia people experience. Although it’s not usually as serious as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), it can still have serious complications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This article will look at CAP, how it compares with other types of pneumonia, and what you can do to protect yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Types of pneumonia</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP):</strong>&nbsp;CAP refers to pneumonia you develop outside a hospital setting.</li><li><strong>Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP):</strong>&nbsp;Also called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535441/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nosocomial pneumoniaTrusted Source</a>, HAP occurs if you fall ill with pneumonia 48 hours or more after your admission to the hospital. HAP is usually more serious than CAP because it can involve bacteria that are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525768/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resistant to antibioticsTrusted Source</a>.</li><li><strong>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP):</strong>&nbsp;A subgroup of people with HAP may develop VAP. It occurs in hospital patients who are receiving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/ventilator">mechanical ventilation</a>&nbsp;for respiratory failure.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What causes community-acquired pneumonia?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pneumonia has many causes.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149822/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research from 2017Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;references 26 common causes of CAP, mainly bacteria and viruses.&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32629490/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some fungiTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;can also cause CAP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430749/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most commonTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;causes of CAP in the United States are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>human rhinovirus (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/cold">common cold</a>)</li><li>influenza virus (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/flu">flu</a>)</li><li><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other common causes include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-covid-19">COVID-19</a>)</li><li><em>Haemophilus influenzae</em></li><li><em>Legionella</em>&nbsp;bacteria</li><li><em>Mycoplasma pneumonia</em></li><li>hard-to-detect bacteria, such as&nbsp;<em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, how do humans come in contact with these germs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of them, like&nbsp;<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, already live in your nose, sinuses, or mouth. They can eventually spread to your lungs, where they cause disease. It’s unclear why they invade the lungs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might also breathe in these germs if they are in the air around you. Certain activities or environments may increase your risk of coming in contact with them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Who is at risk of community-acquired pneumonia?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CAP and its complications are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430749/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most likelyTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;to affect:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Health conditions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certain conditions may increase your risk of developing CAP. According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/479089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 review</a>&nbsp;of 29 studies, these include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/understanding-chronic-bronchitis">chronic bronchitis</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/copd-and-pneumonia-understanding-your-risk">COPD</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/asthma/asthma-and-pneumonia">asthma</a></li><li>diseases of the mouth, teeth, or gums</li><li>conditions that cause impaired function</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the review was inconclusive on whether heart disease was a risk factor, other&nbsp;<a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/70/10/984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research from 2015</a>&nbsp;suggests it is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other conditions, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4879333/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetesTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6280505/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver diseaseTrusted Source</a>, may affect your outlook with CAP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers in the 2017 review also identified certain medications that may increase your risk:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/immunosuppressant-drugs">immunosuppressants</a></li><li>oral steroids</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/proton-pump-inhibitors">proton pump inhibitors</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/h2-blockers">H2 blockers</a>&nbsp;(both used to treat gastric reflux)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Environmental exposure</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/pneumonia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Health OrganizationTrusted Source</a>, environmental factors may also affect your risk of CAP. These include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>indoor air pollution from biomass fuels</li><li>crowded homes</li><li>secondhand smoke</li><li><a href="https://pneumonia.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41479-022-00094-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living on or near a farm with livestockTrusted Source</a></li><li><a href="https://journals.lww.com/environepidem/Fulltext/2018/06000/High_density_poultry_operations_and.5.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living near centers of industrial food animal production</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/70/10/984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2015 research</a>, people who smoke cigarettes also have a higher risk of CAP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Zoonotic (animal) exposure</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exposure to certain animals that may carry the germs that cause CAP could put you at risk. According to research from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165864/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2016Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149822/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017Trusted Source</a>, examples include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>birds, including poultry</li><li>rabbits</li><li>goats</li><li>sheep</li><li>pigs</li><li>cattle</li><li>sick dogs</li><li>cats in labor</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Travel exposure</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The germs that cause CAP exist everywhere in the world. But some regions are more likely to have certain germs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://pneumonia.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41479-017-0026-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ExpertsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;know that travel to large gatherings abroad contributes to the spread of germs that cause CAP. Traveling, spending time on a cruise ship, or staying in a hotel can increase your risk of exposure to these germs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have symptoms of pneumonia, be sure to tell a doctor of any recent travel. It may help them make a diagnosis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What are the symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia?</a></h2>

<p>If a doctor notices you have symptoms of CAP, they will likely perform or order the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Medical history:</strong>&nbsp;A doctor will ask about your medical history to better understand how you may have become ill.</li><li><strong>Physical exam:</strong>&nbsp;A doctor will perform a physical exam to check for fever and lung sounds consistent with pneumonia.</li><li><strong>Chest X-ray:</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/chest-x-ray">chest X-ray</a>&nbsp;can show any fluid buildup or inflammation in the lungs.</li><li><strong>CT scan:</strong>&nbsp;A doctor might use a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/ct-scan">CT scan</a>&nbsp;to confirm a diagnosis or rule out other conditions. CT scans&nbsp;<a href="https://ejrnm.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43055-021-00541-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may be more effective</a>&nbsp;at detecting pneumonia than chest X-rays, but they are more expensive and take longer.</li><li><strong>Complete blood count (CBC):</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cbc">CBC</a>&nbsp;can help doctors see whether your immune system is fighting the infection.</li><li><strong>Electrolyte panel:</strong>&nbsp;An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/basic-metabolic-panel">electrolyte panel</a>&nbsp;can check your electrolyte levels as well as your kidney and liver function.</li><li><strong>Blood, sputum, or urine tests:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/blood-culture">Blood</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/routine-sputum-culture">sputum cultures</a>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8717893/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urine antigen testsTrusted Source</a>, may identify the exact cause of the infection, influencing treatment.</li><li><strong>Molecular testing:</strong>&nbsp;This is the&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/10/2744/5830781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standard</a>&nbsp;way to test for viral pneumonia, such as cases caused by COVID-19.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7132381/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research from 2020Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;has also shown that molecular tests, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, may also be better than cultures at detecting bacterial pneumonia.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A doctor will also consider other potential diagnoses. Some illnesses with symptoms similar to CAP include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What is the treatment for community-acquired pneumonia?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have CAP, your treatment plan will depend on your symptoms and the specific cause of your infection. A doctor will also consider how severe your symptoms are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to 2017 research,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149822/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">80%Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;of people in the United States can treat CAP at home. If your doctor determines you have a milder case of CAP from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bacterial-pneumonia">bacteria</a>, they may prescribe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-do-antibiotics-work">antibiotics</a>&nbsp;for you to take at home. A doctor will likely prescribe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430749/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the followingTrusted Source</a>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/amoxicillin-oral-tablet">amoxicillin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/azithromycin-cost">azithromycin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/clarithromycin-oral-tablet">clarithromycin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/doxycycline-cost">doxycycline</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s important to take antibiotics as prescribed. If you don’t follow the proper regimen, the bacteria could become&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/antibiotics/how-do-bacteria-become-resistant-to-antibiotics">antibiotic resistant</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a more severe case of CAP, you may need to get treatment in a hospital. Healthcare professionals can provide a variety of intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatments based on your specific situation at a hospital.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But antibiotics do not work for cases of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/viral-pneumonia">viral pneumonia</a>. You may need to let the virus run its course. In some cases, you may be able to use antiviral medication. Examples include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>remdesivir (Veklury) for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-treatment">COVID-19</a></li><li>oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/flu-treatments">influenza</a></li><li>inhaled ribavirin for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv">respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are other actions you can take to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pneumonia/treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manage symptoms</a>&nbsp;of viral CAP:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Take over-the-counter pain relievers, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/ibuprofen-vs-acetaminophen">acetaminophen or ibuprofen</a>, to reduce fever.</li><li>Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.</li><li>Get enough rest to allow your body to recover.</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/quit-smoking">Quit smoking</a>&nbsp;if you regularly smoke.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your symptoms are severe, you may need to go to the hospital. Additional treatments in the hospital may include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>oxygen therapy</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/intravenous-fluid-regulation">intravenous (IV) fluids</a></li><li>respiratory support with a ventilator</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What are the potential complications of community-acquired pneumonia?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With CAP comes the risk of possible complications. These are more likely if doctors don’t make a timely diagnosis or if initial treatments don’t work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162259/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Possible complicationsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Pleural effusion:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pleural-effusion">Pleural effusion</a>&nbsp;is the buildup of fluid in your pleura, the space between your lungs and chest wall.</li><li><strong>Empyema:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/empyema">Empyema</a>&nbsp;is the buildup of pus in the pleural space.</li><li><strong>Lung abscesses:</strong>&nbsp;An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/lung-abscess">abscess</a>&nbsp;is a pus-filled cavity that, in this case, forms in your lung.</li><li><strong>Sepsis:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sepsis">Sepsis</a>&nbsp;is an extreme immune response to an infection.</li><li><strong>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS):</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/acute-respiratory-failure">ARDS</a>&nbsp;occurs when the lungs become severely inflamed and fill with fluid, preventing oxygen from getting into the blood.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Complications like sepsis and ARDS can cause organ failure and death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What is the outlook for people with community-acquired pneumonia?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With rapid and appropriate treatment, many people fully recover from CAP without complications. Young people tend to recover fully more quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If CAP is due to bacteria, you may start to feel better&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430749/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within 5 to 7 daysTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;of starting antibiotics. Still, it can take&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pneumonia/treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">months</a>&nbsp;for all your symptoms to resolve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a mild case of CAP, full recovery is possible with rest, antibiotics or antivirals, and sleep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More severe cases of CAP may require lengthy hospital stays to help keep you stable and aid recovery. For people admitted to intensive care, the death rate can be as high as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430749/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">23%Trusted Source</a>, according to 2021 research.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>How can I prevent community-acquired pneumonia?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking precautions against illness, such as getting an annual flu shot, can reduce your risk of CAP. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/qa_fluzone.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;recommends that people ages 65 and older get a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/flu/flu-shots-seniors-types-cost">high dose flu vaccine</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People over 65 can also consider getting the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-does-a-pneumonia-shot-last">pneumococcal vaccine</a>&nbsp;to prevent CAP. This is especially important if you have other health conditions or if you smoke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may need a booster shot if you received your vaccine before age 65, or if you have a weakened immune system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other everyday actions you can do to help prevent disease include the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/washing-hands">Wash your hands</a>&nbsp;frequently, especially after using the bathroom or being in public.</li><li>Cough into your elbow when you need to cough.</li><li>Keep a physical distance from people who are ill.</li><li>If you smoke or vape, consider quitting to reduce damage to your lungs. Such damage can make you more vulnerable to pneumonia infection.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Takeaway</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common type of pneumonia. The term refers to pneumonia that you contract outside of a hospital setting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While many people recover from CAP with rest and antibiotic or antiviral treatment, it can be especially serious for older adults and people with existing health conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Potential complications of CAP can be life threatening. But people in high risk groups can take precautions against severe disease, such as getting an annual flu shot.</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pneumonia is a lung infection that’s caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It ranges from mild to severe. Some cases of pneumonia occur as a complication of another infection, like influenza or COVID-19. It can affect the entirety of your lungs or only certain portions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your lungs are divided into five lobes — an upper, middle lobe, and lower lobe on the right as well as an upper and lower lobe on the left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While there are many types of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pneumonia">pneumonia</a>&nbsp;based on the organism that caused the infection, pneumonia is generally divided into two major groups based on how much of your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/lung">lungs</a>&nbsp;is affected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depending on which lobes or areas of your respiratory system are affected, you may be diagnosed with:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Bronchopneumonia.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bronchopneumonia">Bronchopneumonia</a>&nbsp;is a type of pneumonia that mostly affects the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bronchitis-vs-pneumonia">bronchi and bronchioles</a>. These are the system of tubes that bring air into your lungs. This type of pneumonia often spreads to other parts of the lungs if not treated effectively.</li><li><strong>Lobar pneumonia.</strong>&nbsp;This refers to any type of pneumonia that causes congestion or inflammation — a condition known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/lung-consolidation">consolidation</a>&nbsp;— which affects an entire lobe of your lung.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When bronchopneumonia moves out of its initial stage, it’s usually progressed to lobar pneumonia. Lobar pneumonia has four distinct phases of infection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>The 4 stages of pneumonia</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pneumonia remains a&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s15010-021-01689-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading cause of death</a>&nbsp;worldwide. Lobar pneumonia is typically the more fatal form of this infection because it tends to encompass the entirety of the lobe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While lobar pneumonia is usually described as moving through phases, new research suggests that severe illness or even death can occur in any of these stages, and you may not move through these stages in an orderly fashion. It’s also possible for you to be in more than one stage of this progression at a time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typically, these stages are used to help guide treatment and grade the severity of a lobar pneumonia infection. Below is an explanation of each stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Congestion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is typically the first stage of infection that occurs after a pneumonia infection has dominated one of the lobes in your lung. The congestion stage typically lasts around 24 hours, and your lungs become inflamed, red, and weighed down by infection. Microscopic examination of your lung tissue in this phase would show engorged blood vessels and swelling in the tiny air sacs of your lungs (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alveoli-function">alveoli</a>) where carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Red hepatization</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is traditionally recognized at the second stage of lobar pneumonia, and it usually lasts for a few days. During this time, immune cells accumulate in large numbers in the spaces around your alveoli as they try to fight off the infection. Swelling around the alveoli is replaced with strands of fibrous tissue, and your lung tissue becomes dry and firm. In this stage, your alveoli are not able to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/impaired-gas-exchange-related-to-copd">move oxygen and other gases</a>&nbsp;into your bloodstream as well. The red blood cells that carry oxygen and other nutrients can burst and leak, giving your lung tissue a pink or red appearance under a microscope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Gray hepatization</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This stage usually appears 2 to 3 days after the red hepatization stage and can last for up to 8 days. Fibrous tissue and secretions increase as red blood cells are destroyed.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hemosiderin-staining">Hemosiderin</a>, a protein that stores iron in your tissues, may accumulate. These changes in your cells and tissues can create staining or discoloration of your lung tissue, giving a gray or darkened appearance on microscopic examination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Resolution</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have reached the resolution phase, enzymes and other immune cells have been able to mount a defense against the infection and dissolve fibrous growths that restricted gas exchange. Immune cells called macrophages clear dead tissue debris, and your alveoli function begins to recover.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What are the symptoms of&nbsp;lobar pneumonia?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The symptoms you experience with pneumonia can depend on whether it was caused by bacteria, a virus, or fungus, and your overall health. Below are examples of some symptoms you may notice as lobar pneumonia progresses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Symptoms during the congestion phase</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the early phase of pneumonia, you may experience things like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>congestion</li><li>fever</li><li>fatigue</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/wet-cough">wet cough</a>&nbsp;with sputum (phlegm)</li><li>chest pain</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Symptoms during the red hepatization phase</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you move into more advanced stages of pneumonia, you may be increasingly weak or tired as your body tries to fight the infection. You may start to see sputum production or coughing decrease as swelling in the alveoli increases. When this happens, you may become&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-does-shortness-of-breath-feel-like">short of breath</a>&nbsp;or have difficulty breathing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Symptoms during the gray hepatization phase</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the more severe phase of lobar pneumonia, and while you may not notice as much coughing or sputum production, shortness of breath is common. Your alveoli are surrounded by swelling and fibrous strands that keep them from moving gases like oxygen in and out of your bloodstream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>MEDICAL EMERGENCY</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might have symptoms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hypoxemia">hypoxia</a>&nbsp;as your gas exchange is impaired. This is a life threatening emergency. Call emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room if you experience:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/skin-discoloration-bluish">blueish tinge</a>&nbsp;to your lips or nail beds</li><li>severe shortness of breath</li><li>dizziness</li><li>confusion</li><li>a rapid heartbeat</li><li>shallow breathing</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this stage, supplemental oxygen or even mechanical ventilation may be required to prevent additional complications from hypoxia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Symptoms during the resolution phase</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the resolution phase, your infection is beginning to clear. You may have more energy, and your shortness of breath may be improving. However, you could also notice an increase or return in coughing and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/green-phlegm">sputum</a>&nbsp;production as your body works to clear dead tissues and other debris from your lungs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>When to see a doctor if you think you have&nbsp;pneumonia</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be difficult to tell the difference between any type of cold or respiratory infection and pneumonia in the early stages. Many respiratory infections can cause a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/types-of-coughs">cough</a>&nbsp;that’s either wet or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dry-cough">dry</a>&nbsp;and begins to clear in 2 to 3 weeks. If your cough is lasting longer, or becoming more severe during that time even with medication, you may want to see a doctor.</p>

<h2><a>Managing lobar pneumonia during its four stages</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How you are treated for pneumonia will depend on the infection that triggered it and how sick you become. Antibiotics are typically used to treat pneumonia, but viral and fungal pneumonia may require alternative treatments.</p>

<h3>Early pneumonia</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In early phases of pneumonia like the congestion phase, or in people who don’t have other significant health conditions that could complicate the pneumonia, broad-spectrum antibiotics designed to treat a variety of infections are usually offered without testing to confirm your specific strain of pneumonia. This may include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/no-need-to-take-all-your-antibiotics-researchers-say#How-the-practice-got-started">antibiotics</a>&nbsp;like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/azithromycin-cost">azithromycin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/clarithromycin-oral-tablet">clarithromycin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/levofloxacin-oral-tablet">levofloxacin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/moxifloxacin-oral-tablet">moxifloxacin</a></li><li>gemifloxacin</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These antibiotics target the most common causes of pneumonia. You may also find relief with treatments like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>fluids to thin your secretions and mucus</li><li>rest</li><li>medications to control your fever</li><li>using a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/humidifiers-and-health">humidifier</a></li></ul>

<h3>Note</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speak with a doctor before taking over-the-counter cough and cold medications for pneumonia. Some medications can cause drying, which may make your symptoms worse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Severe or complicated pneumonia</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you move into the red or gray hepatization phases of pneumonia, you may need to be treated with intravenous antibiotics or fluids. You may also require supplemental oxygen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medications used in more severe cases of pneumonia requiring inpatient care usually include formulas that combine more than one type of antibiotic, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>fluoroquinolones</li><li>beta-lactams</li><li>cephalosporin</li><li>macrolides</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Viral pneumonia caused by influenza may also require the use of oseltamivir, an antiviral medication, which is predominantly used to shorten the course of viral pneumonia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In severe cases, you may also need direct drainage of fluids from your lungs with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/chest-tube-insertion">chest tube</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/chest-tube-insertion">chest tube</a>&nbsp;could be used if a person develops a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/parapneumonic-effusion">parapneumonic effusion</a>, which is not in the lungs but around the lungs in the thoracic cavity, which is also known as the pleural space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will be observed closely for any complications if you have other health conditions like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>kidney disease</li><li>liver disease</li><li>cancer</li><li>other lung conditions</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People with other conditions are more likely to have pneumonia that progresses to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sepsis">sepsis</a>&nbsp;or multi-organ failure and even death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a>Takeaway</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pneumonia/can-you-die-from-pneumonia">Pneumonia</a>&nbsp;can be serious and even fatal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lobar pneumonia is the most serious type. It develops when one or more of the five lobes in your lung becomes completely congested by the infection. When this happens, your lung tissue is unable to move oxygen and other gases in and out of your blood, and serious complications may develop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you think you may have pneumonia, or if you experience symptoms like shortness of breath or confusion after a period of illness, see a doctor. Pneumonia can progress through several stages, but medical care is important in all of them</p>
